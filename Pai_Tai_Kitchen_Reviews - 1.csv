Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Shame there was no thai iced coffee.","New York, NY",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Becky G.,3 star rating,"My friend loves this restaurant. Me, well, it's just ok for me. #1 way too crowded inside. People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

On the positive side the server was good.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry. Had high hopes for this place. Made it before open so waited about 15 mins on a Thursday morning. Restaurant was larger than I expected so that was nice.,"Orange County, CA",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Becky G.,3 star rating,"My friend loves this restaurant. Me, well, it's just ok for me. #1 way too crowded inside. People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins.

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins.

Food:

# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger.

The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Becky G.,3 star rating,"My friend loves this restaurant. Me, well, it's just ok for me. #1 way too crowded inside. People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry. Had high hopes for this place. Made it before open so waited about 15 mins on a Thursday morning. Restaurant was larger than I expected so that was nice.,"Orange County, CA",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Becky G.,3 star rating,"My friend loves this restaurant. Me, well, it's just ok for me. #1 way too crowded inside. People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

On the positive side the server was good.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry. Had high hopes for this place. Made it before open so waited about 15 mins on a Thursday morning. Restaurant was larger than I expected so that was nice.,"Orange County, CA",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Becky G.,3 star rating,"My friend loves this restaurant. Me, well, it's just ok for me. #1 way too crowded inside. People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

On the positive side the server was good.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Becky G.,3 star rating,"My friend loves this restaurant. Me, well, it's just ok for me. #1 way too crowded inside. People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

On the positive side the server was good.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry. Had high hopes for this place. Made it before open so waited about 15 mins on a Thursday morning. Restaurant was larger than I expected so that was nice.,"Orange County, CA",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Becky G.,3 star rating,"My friend loves this restaurant. Me, well, it's just ok for me. #1 way too crowded inside. People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

On the positive side the server was good.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry. Had high hopes for this place. Made it before open so waited about 15 mins on a Thursday morning. Restaurant was larger than I expected so that was nice.,"Orange County, CA",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Becky G.,3 star rating,"My friend loves this restaurant. Me, well, it's just ok for me. #1 way too crowded inside. People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

On the positive side the server was good.

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry. Had high hopes for this place. Made it before open so waited about 15 mins on a Thursday morning. Restaurant was larger than I expected so that was nice.,"Orange County, CA",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Restaurant was larger than I expected so that was nice.,"Orange County, CA",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry. Had high hopes for this place. Made it before open so waited about 15 mins on a Thursday morning. Restaurant was larger than I expected so that was nice.,"Orange County, CA",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Restaurant was larger than I expected so that was nice.,"Orange County, CA",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry. Had high hopes for this place. Made it before open so waited about 15 mins on a Thursday morning. Restaurant was larger than I expected so that was nice.,"Orange County, CA",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Restaurant was larger than I expected so that was nice.,"Orange County, CA",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

On the positive side the server was good.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

On the positive side the server was good.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Becky G.,3 star rating,"My friend loves this restaurant. Me, well, it's just ok for me. #1 way too crowded inside. People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

On the positive side the server was good.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Becky G.,3 star rating,"My friend loves this restaurant. Me, well, it's just ok for me. #1 way too crowded inside. People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

On the positive side the server was good.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

On the positive side the server was good.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

On the positive side the server was good.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy.

We are group of 5. Ordered

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Aiko I.Elite 23,4 star rating,"Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins.

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins.

Food:

# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger.

The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours.

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry.

Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Becky G.,3 star rating,"My friend loves this restaurant. Me, well, it's just ok for me. #1 way too crowded inside. People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry. Had high hopes for this place. Made it before open so waited about 15 mins on a Thursday morning. Restaurant was larger than I expected so that was nice.,"Orange County, CA",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Becky G.,3 star rating,"My friend loves this restaurant. Me, well, it's just ok for me. #1 way too crowded inside. People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

On the positive side the server was good.

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Food:
# THAI CHICKEN WINGS
# GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters )
# MOO PING (grilled pork skewers)
# GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken)
# GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef)
# PAD SEE EW (Shrimp)

Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli).

The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick.

The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as ""wow"".

Drinks (Cocktails)
# GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.)
# THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower)
# RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime)

All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick.

The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!","Whitby, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Lela A.Elite 23,3 star rating,Tom yum soup was best I've ever had. Very flavorful! Chicken wings and pad see ew were disappointing. The chicken in the pad see ew was very noticeably old and dry. Had high hopes for this place. Made it before open so waited about 15 mins on a Thursday morning. Restaurant was larger than I expected so that was nice.,"Orange County, CA",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Elaine N.Elite 23,3 star rating,"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened!

We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy!

Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick.

I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

Albert K.,5 star rating,"- excellent chips!
- pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp
- fried shrimp was excellent
- really good pineapple juice

The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks.

Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless.

Shame there was no thai iced coffee.","New York, NY",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"
Becky G.,3 star rating,"My friend loves this restaurant. Me, well, it's just ok for me. #1 way too crowded inside. People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy.

On the positive side the server was good.

Don't know if I would return.","Maple, Vaughan, Canada",Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,554 reviews)"

I was stoked to sample the Tom Yum Soup and Chicken Pad Thai. They were both drool-worthy dishes to say the least. I love an authentic Pad Thai that isn't dripping in sauce. This for the bill. And the Tom Yum Soup left me craving more.

Want to dabble in the kitchen yourself?!

Well, not actually ""here,"" but you can order a copy of their cookbook via their website and cook up some of their killer recipes for yourself. Score!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is easily at the top of my ""Must Nosh"" lost in Toronto. Check it out for yourself!
