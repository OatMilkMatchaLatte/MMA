Alana B.,5 star rating,"We got there late afternoon, it was quiet and we were seated promptly. The staff was super accommodating as we were from out of town and taking a burger back with us. We ordered 2 Our Burgers, a poutine and onion rings to eat there. All were excellent! The onion rings were very unique as well as delicious. The hostess offered to take our picture in front of the wall and cut outs. It was an amazing, if not slightly surreal experience.","Rockland, Clarence-Rockland, ON",Wahlburgers,(347 reviews)
Dustin W.Elite 23,3 star rating,"Very cool layout with a bunch of Mark Wahlberg tributes. Even the bathroom has a cool Ted peeing reference. The place also has a bar which is unique.

When it comes to the food, it's really not that great... the fries are mediocre, the burgers have some unique ingredients but the taste is lackluster, the shake is decent but small.

Honestly crazy crazy overpriced for what this is. It feels like branded name food x3 the price in my opinion. At least the staff was very nice, and the tables had outlets so I could charge my phone

Lyn D.,2 star rating,The restaurant is pretty decent in size. Lots of staff-they're fine I suppose.. Seems to be in a rush like they make customers feel that you just eat and go right away to clear the table for the next customer.. I ordered Margarita and it taste watery. I hardly taste the tequila and it was even in a half empty glass with little ice cubes! First and last probably..,"Toronto, ON",Wahlburgers,(347 reviews)
Tim W.,2 star rating,"Have heard about Wahlburgers ever since the reality TV show. Had my first visit/burger today. Staff was nice. Ambience OK. However, there was nothing to recommend the burger. Todays will be my only Wahlburger.

Had I made this burger on my own barbecue, I probably would have served it with a bit of an apology - ""Usually, they are better.""

The lack of any redeeming quality is surprising because it took 10 min and was made to order.","Regina, SK",Wahlburgers,(347 reviews)
Geraldine G.Elite 23,2 star rating,"Since this American burgers joint opened I've been meaning to trying it.

The customer service was good but other than that I can't say there's much else to pull me in

The burger was disappointing. Really dry or overcooked. Not juicy at all. The tomato was
what I'd call juicy lol

The Sweet potato tots were not bad. That and the chocolate milkshake (frappe as they like to call it) were the best of what I had but they were by no means standouts and something I could easily acquire elsewhere and better tasting.

I'm glad to have tried it but can't say I'd eat there again.","Toronto, ON",Wahlburgers,(347 reviews)
Mark K.Elite 23,4 star rating,"I had never been to a Wahlburgers before and I have to say that I enjoyed my first visit. This location just up the street from the Rogers Centre apparently has not been open for too long. It's down the road from the hotel at which I stay when I visit our Canadian office and I had never seen it until this trip. It is apparently the hotel restaurant for the SoHo Metropolitan Hotel.

The dining area was spacious and the atmosphere relaxed, as you'd expect for a casual burger joint. The menu options were more than adequately varied for the type of place it was. I had a Turkey burger with tater tots, which I thought was quite tasty. My colleague had a Double Decker burger with fries, about which he was also quite positive. He also had ice cream to finish while I had a coffee. We both felt the food quality was quite good and the service was excellent. Our waitress was pleasant and efficient, and the food came out quickly after our order. The prices were not bad for everything we had. The final bill with food, drinks, tax and tip was about $30 CAD per person. This was a little over $20 USD per person with the exchange rates at the time. That's about right for a gourmet burger place from my perspective.","Adrian, United States",Wahlburgers,(347 reviews)
Niki G.,3 star rating,First time I ordered for beer and I ordered their slugger combo the hot dog was small and very salty and I think it was the toppings that made it very salty the french fries were also salty and just not worth the price I was very disappointed because I was expecting a lot better I don't think I'll order from here again,"Toronto, ON",Wahlburgers,(347 reviews)
Ella M.,1 star rating,I expected a lot more from this place. I got the our burger and it was horrible. Idk if it's the pickles or the sauce but something tasted like a gross vape juice flavour it was weird... my boyfriend got the bacon bbq burger and i had a bite and didn't like that either. Also i'm not a picky eater it just had way too much bbq sauce. the fries are good. We also went on a Saturday at 7pm and it was pretty much empty so that's how u know it's not worth it.,"Uptown Core, Oakville, ON",Wahlburgers,(347 reviews)

Maria T.Elite 23,4 star rating,"First impression... I liked the bright vibe in the restaurant. When you walk in, you can elect to sit in the front section to be served or to order at a counter in the back and seat yourself.

We opted to be served. Our server was great... Friendly. I think she could have used help though. She didn't have time to give proper attention to all her tables. Hubby and I both ordered the OFD burger with onion rings. He thought the burger was greasy but still enjoyed it. I didn't mind the grease... Yum! I thought the burger was juicy! We liked the onion rings but they could have been crispier. Our son ordered the ""EH"" burger and devoured it. He loves burgers with fried eggs. His tator tots were deliciously seasoned and were perfectly crisp on the outside.

My son said he thought they didn't have enough burgers to choose from. I might agree with him but we were all happy with the ones we ordered.

I guess the only negative was that it was very pricey. $60 for 3 burgers, 1 onion ring, 1 tator tot, and 2 sodas. But we expected it. Overall, glad we came.

We parked in an outside lot for $10, 1 block away.","Woodridge, United States",Wahlburgers,(347 reviews)

Dustin W.Elite 23,3 star rating,"Very cool layout with a bunch of Mark Wahlberg tributes. Even the bathroom has a cool Ted peeing reference. The place also has a bar which is unique.

When it comes to the food, it's really not that great... the fries are mediocre, the burgers have some unique ingredients but the taste is lackluster, the shake is decent but small.

Honestly crazy crazy overpriced for what this is. It feels like branded name food x3 the price in my opinion. At least the staff was very nice, and the tables had outlets so I could charge my phone

Tim W.,2 star rating,"Have heard about Wahlburgers ever since the reality TV show. Had my first visit/burger today. Staff was nice. Ambience OK. However, there was nothing to recommend the burger. Todays will be my only Wahlburger.

Had I made this burger on my own barbecue, I probably would have served it with a bit of an apology - ""Usually, they are better.""

The lack of any redeeming quality is surprising because it took 10 min and was made to order.","Regina, SK",Wahlburgers,(347 reviews)
Geraldine G.Elite 23,2 star rating,"Since this American burgers joint opened I've been meaning to trying it.

The customer service was good but other than that I can't say there's much else to pull me in

The burger was disappointing. Really dry or overcooked. Not juicy at all. The tomato was
what I'd call juicy lol

The Sweet potato tots were not bad. That and the chocolate milkshake (frappe as they like to call it) were the best of what I had but they were by no means standouts and something I could easily acquire elsewhere and better tasting.

Mark K.Elite 23,4 star rating,"I had never been to a Wahlburgers before and I have to say that I enjoyed my first visit. This location just up the street from the Rogers Centre apparently has not been open for too long. It's down the road from the hotel at which I stay when I visit our Canadian office and I had never seen it until this trip. It is apparently the hotel restaurant for the SoHo Metropolitan Hotel.

The dining area was spacious and the atmosphere relaxed, as you'd expect for a casual burger joint. The menu options were more than adequately varied for the type of place it was. I had a Turkey burger with tater tots, which I thought was quite tasty. My colleague had a Double Decker burger with fries, about which he was also quite positive. He also had ice cream to finish while I had a coffee. We both felt the food quality was quite good and the service was excellent. Our waitress was pleasant and efficient, and the food came out quickly after our order. The prices were not bad for everything we had. The final bill with food, drinks, tax and tip was about $30 CAD per person. This was a little over $20 USD per person with the exchange rates at the time.

Honestly crazy crazy overpriced for what this is. It feels like branded name food x3 the price in my opinion. At least the staff was very nice, and the tables had outlets so I could charge my phone

Tim W.,2 star rating,"Have heard about Wahlburgers ever since the reality TV show. Had my first visit/burger today. Staff was nice. Ambience OK. However, there was nothing to recommend the burger. Todays will be my only Wahlburger.

Had I made this burger on my own barbecue, I probably would have served it with a bit of an apology - ""Usually, they are better.""

The lack of any redeeming quality is surprising because it took 10 min and was made to order.","Regina, SK",Wahlburgers,(347 reviews)
Geraldine G.Elite 23,2 star rating,"Since this American burgers joint opened I've been meaning to trying it.

The customer service was good but other than that I can't say there's much else to pull me in

The burger was disappointing. Really dry or overcooked. Not juicy at all. The tomato was
what I'd call juicy lol

The Sweet potato tots were not bad. That and the chocolate milkshake (frappe as they like to call it) were the best of what I had but they were by no means standouts and something I could easily acquire elsewhere and better tasting.

Mark K.Elite 23,4 star rating,"I had never been to a Wahlburgers before and I have to say that I enjoyed my first visit. This location just up the street from the Rogers Centre apparently has not been open for too long. It's down the road from the hotel at which I stay when I visit our Canadian office and I had never seen it until this trip. It is apparently the hotel restaurant for the SoHo Metropolitan Hotel.

The dining area was spacious and the atmosphere relaxed, as you'd expect for a casual burger joint. The menu options were more than adequately varied for the type of place it was. I had a Turkey burger with tater tots, which I thought was quite tasty. My colleague had a Double Decker burger with fries, about which he was also quite positive. He also had ice cream to finish while I had a coffee. We both felt the food quality was quite good and the service was excellent. Our waitress was pleasant and efficient, and the food came out quickly after our order. The prices were not bad for everything we had. The final bill with food, drinks, tax and tip was about $30 CAD per person. This was a little over $20 USD per person with the exchange rates at the time.

Lyn D.,2 star rating,The restaurant is pretty decent in size. Lots of staff-they're fine I suppose.. Seems to be in a rush like they make customers feel that you just eat and go right away to clear the table for the next customer.. I ordered Margarita and it taste watery. I hardly taste the tequila and it was even in a half empty glass with little ice cubes! First and last probably..,"Toronto, ON",Wahlburgers,(347 reviews)
Tim W.,2 star rating,"Have heard about Wahlburgers ever since the reality TV show. Had my first visit/burger today. Staff was nice. Ambience OK. However, there was nothing to recommend the burger. Todays will be my only Wahlburger.

Had I made this burger on my own barbecue, I probably would have served it with a bit of an apology - ""Usually, they are better.""

The lack of any redeeming quality is surprising because it took 10 min and was made to order.","Regina, SK",Wahlburgers,(347 reviews)
Geraldine G.Elite 23,2 star rating,"Since this American burgers joint opened I've been meaning to trying it.

The customer service was good but other than that I can't say there's much else to pull me in

The burger was disappointing. Really dry or overcooked. Not juicy at all. The tomato was
what I'd call juicy lol

The Sweet potato tots were not bad. That and the chocolate milkshake (frappe as they like to call it) were the best of what I had but they were by no means standouts and something I could easily acquire elsewhere and better tasting.

I'm glad to have tried it but can't say I'd eat there again.","Toronto, ON",Wahlburgers,(347 reviews)
Mark K.Elite 23,4 star rating,"I had never been to a Wahlburgers before and I have to say that I enjoyed my first visit. This location just up the street from the Rogers Centre apparently has not been open for too long. It's down the road from the hotel at which I stay when I visit our Canadian office and I had never seen it until this trip. It is apparently the hotel restaurant for the SoHo Metropolitan Hotel.

The dining area was spacious and the atmosphere relaxed, as you'd expect for a casual burger joint. The menu options were more than adequately varied for the type of place it was. I had a Turkey burger with tater tots, which I thought was quite tasty. My colleague had a Double Decker burger with fries, about which he was also quite positive. He also had ice cream to finish while I had a coffee. We both felt the food quality was quite good and the service was excellent. Our waitress was pleasant and efficient, and the food came out quickly after our order. The prices were not bad for everything we had. The final bill with food, drinks, tax and tip was about $30 CAD per person. This was a little over $20 USD per person with the exchange rates at the time. That's about right for a gourmet burger place from my perspective.","Adrian, United States",Wahlburgers,(347 reviews)

Idk if it's the pickles or the sauce but something tasted like a gross vape juice flavour it was weird... my boyfriend got the bacon bbq burger and i had a bite and didn't like that either. Also i'm not a picky eater it just had way too much bbq sauce. the fries are good.

We opted to be served. Our server was great... Friendly. I think she could have used help though. She didn't have time to give proper attention to all her tables. Hubby and I both ordered the OFD burger with onion rings. He thought the burger was greasy but still enjoyed it. I didn't mind the grease... Yum! I thought the burger was juicy! We liked the onion rings but they could have been crispier. Our son ordered the ""EH"" burger and devoured it. He loves burgers with fried eggs. His tator tots were deliciously seasoned and were perfectly crisp on the outside.

My son said he thought they didn't have enough burgers to choose from. I might agree with him but we were all happy with the ones we ordered.

I guess the only negative was that it was very pricey. $60 for 3 burgers, 1 onion ring, 1 tator tot, and 2 sodas. But we expected it. Overall, glad we came.

Had I made this burger on my own barbecue, I probably would have served it with a bit of an apology - ""Usually, they are better.""

Geraldine G.Elite 23,2 star rating,"Since this American burgers joint opened I've been meaning to trying it.

The customer service was good but other than that I can't say there's much else to pull me in

The burger was disappointing. Really dry or overcooked. Not juicy at all. The tomato was
what I'd call juicy lol

The Sweet potato tots were not bad. That and the chocolate milkshake (frappe as they like to call it) were the best of what I had but they were by no means standouts and something I could easily acquire elsewhere and better tasting.

Mark K.Elite 23,4 star rating,"I had never been to a Wahlburgers before and I have to say that I enjoyed my first visit. This location just up the street from the Rogers Centre apparently has not been open for too long. It's down the road from the hotel at which I stay when I visit our Canadian office and I had never seen it until this trip. It is apparently the hotel restaurant for the SoHo Metropolitan Hotel.

The dining area was spacious and the atmosphere relaxed, as you'd expect for a casual burger joint. The menu options were more than adequately varied for the type of place it was. I had a Turkey burger with tater tots, which I thought was quite tasty. My colleague had a Double Decker burger with fries, about which he was also quite positive. He also had ice cream to finish while I had a coffee. We both felt the food quality was quite good and the service was excellent. Our waitress was pleasant and efficient, and the food came out quickly after our order. The prices were not bad for everything we had. The final bill with food, drinks, tax and tip was about $30 CAD per person. This was a little over $20 USD per person with the exchange rates at the time.

The lack of any redeeming quality is surprising because it took 10 min and was made to order.","Regina, SK",Wahlburgers,(347 reviews)
Geraldine G.Elite 23,2 star rating,"Since this American burgers joint opened I've been meaning to trying it.

The customer service was good but other than that I can't say there's much else to pull me in

The burger was disappointing. Really dry or overcooked. Not juicy at all. The tomato was
what I'd call juicy lol

The Sweet potato tots were not bad. That and the chocolate milkshake (frappe as they like to call it) were the best of what I had but they were by no means standouts and something I could easily acquire elsewhere and better tasting.

Mark K.Elite 23,4 star rating,"I had never been to a Wahlburgers before and I have to say that I enjoyed my first visit. This location just up the street from the Rogers Centre apparently has not been open for too long. It's down the road from the hotel at which I stay when I visit our Canadian office and I had never seen it until this trip. It is apparently the hotel restaurant for the SoHo Metropolitan Hotel.

The dining area was spacious and the atmosphere relaxed, as you'd expect for a casual burger joint. The menu options were more than adequately varied for the type of place it was. I had a Turkey burger with tater tots, which I thought was quite tasty. My colleague had a Double Decker burger with fries, about which he was also quite positive. He also had ice cream to finish while I had a coffee. We both felt the food quality was quite good and the service was excellent. Our waitress was pleasant and efficient, and the food came out quickly after our order. The prices were not bad for everything we had. The final bill with food, drinks, tax and tip was about $30 CAD per person. This was a little over $20 USD per person with the exchange rates at the time.

My son said he thought they didn't have enough burgers to choose from. I might agree with him but we were all happy with the ones we ordered.

I guess the only negative was that it was very pricey. $60 for 3 burgers, 1 onion ring, 1 tator tot, and 2 sodas. But we expected it. Overall, glad we came.
